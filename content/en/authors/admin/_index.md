I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [UB School of Economics](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/phd_students/serrano-puente-dario/) and [IEB](https://ieb.ub.edu/en/researcher/serrano-puente-dario/). During the first year of my PhD studies, I am working as a PhD Researcher (Trainee) at [Autoridad Independiente de Responsabilidad Fiscal (AIReF)](https://www.airef.es/en/) in the Public Policy Evaluation department.

I develop my research in Economics from both empiric and theoretical perspectives. Thus, I work with both micro-simulation tools ((exploiting large micro-datasets)) and quantitative macroeconomics (heterogeneous agents models) methods. I currently udertake research projects on fiscal policy issues, pension and redistribution system, and monitoring structural characteristics of the Spanish economy.

I have obtained my Master of Science in Economics from [Universität Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) in 2020 and my Bachelor's degree in Economics from [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](https://www.uam.es/Economicas/1WelcomeWhyChooseUS/1242693242572.htm?language=en) in 2016.

Previously, I have also worked at [CUNEF](https://www.cunef.edu/) (Research Economist at Department of Economics) | [Bank of Spain](https://www.bde.es/bde/en/) (Research Economist at [DG Economics, Statistics and Research](https://www.bde.es/investigador/en/)) | [NERA Economic Consulting](https://www.nera.com/practice-areas/energy.html#tab-4) (Research Associate at Energy Division), [Management Solutions](https://www.managementsolutions.com/en) (Consultant at Financial Risks Area), and [John Deere](https://www.deere.com/en/) (Financial Department).
